# TurnBaseCore

A flexible .NET library for building the logic of 2D turn-based games.

## About The Project

`TurnBaseCore` is a lightweight and extensible C# library that provides the core components for any 2D turn-based game. Whether you're creating a classic board game like chess or checkers, or a complex turn-based RPG, this library aims to handle the core mechanics, allowing you to focus on the unique aspects of your game.

The project is designed to be engine-agnostic. You can integrate its logic into Godot, Unity, or any other framework.

### Key Features (Planned)

*   **Entity Management:** Define characters, pieces, or any game units with customizable stats.
*   **Grid System:** A flexible system for managing the game state on a 2D plane.
*   **Turn Manager:** A simple yet powerful system to control the turn order between players or AI.
*   **Action/Command System:** Describe and process game actions (e.g., move, attack, use item) in a structured way.
