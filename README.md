# TurnBaseCore

A flexible .NET library for building the logic of 2D turn-based games.

## About The Project

`TurnBaseCore` is a lightweight and extensible C# library that provides the core components for any 2D turn-based game. Whether you're creating a classic board game like chess or checkers, or a complex turn-based RPG, this library aims to handle the core mechanics, allowing you to focus on the unique aspects of your game.

The project is designed to be engine-agnostic. You can integrate its logic into Godot, Unity, or any other framework.
